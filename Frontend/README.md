# Plant Visualizer

## Introduction

This project is one part of part four project #62 from 2023 Done by Eva Sorensen and Max Nankivell. This reporsitory contains the code for the visualization software created and the other repository named "creating-a-mesh-from-plant-images" contains the code for building a 3D model. This visualization software is a React dashboard application designed for farmers and researchers to be able to view and manage information to do with their plants.

## Prerequisites

- OS any should work but the project was build on windows
- Nodejs 18.16.0

## Installation guide

> npm install
```

There are instructions on others commands you can run in the README file within the directory.

## How to run

To run the project just run the following command in the dashboard directory

```
> npm run dev
```

## Code structure

This project is structured pretty conventionally for a React project built with Vite. If you are coming to this project with little to no knowledge of this project or web development. Key technologies used which you must research to understand the code are:

- NPM
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- eslint
- prettier
- Ant design
- SASS

There is also a Mixpanel project used for collecting interaction data from users and a Qualtrics project for doing user evaluation surveys, both of which Ho Seok Ahn and Trevor Gee should have access to so if these are necessary tools for you they should be contacted.
